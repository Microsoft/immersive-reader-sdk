# Immersive Reader - Swift iOS Sample

## Prerequisites

* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* An Immersive Reader resource configured for Azure Active Directory authentication. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/immersive-reader/how-to-create-immersive-reader) to get set up. You will need some of the values created here when configuring the sample project properties. Save the output of your session into a text file for future reference.

## Usage

Microsoft 1st Party Office applications should use the `v0.0.3` Immersive Reader JavaScript SDK and the `v0.0.1` SDK's authentication token retrieved by providing a `SubscriptionKey` and `Region`. This will ensure the Immersive Reader uses Office compliant APIs deployed to OSI.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a Microsoft Internal billable App Service Subscription via the AIRS portal: https://aka.ms/airs and be sure to add more than one owner.
1. Once you have access to the Subscription created via AIRS in the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com - use it to create the Immersive Reader Resource.
1. From the Subscription go to Resources and click the `Add` button.
1. Search for "Immersive Reader" and click the `Create` button.
1. Provide the project details, ensuring one of the following regions is selected: `eastus`, `westus`, `northeurope`, `westeurope`, `centralindia`, `japaneast`, `australiaeast` (the Learning tools Service on OSI only supports these regions) and click next.
1. (optional) Add any tags and click next.
1. Review the terms and click the `Create` button (itâ€™ll take a moment to deploy).
1. Once deployed, click the `Go to resource` button.
1. Click on the `Keys and Endpoint` button in the side menu.
1. These are your secrets. `KEY 1` is the `SubscriptionKey`, `LOCATION` is the `Region`.
1. Open Xcode and open **immersive-reader-sdk/js/samples/ios/quickstart-swift/quickstart-swift.xcodeproj**.
1. In the top menu, click on **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme...**
1. In the **Run** view, click on the **Arguments** tab.
1. In the **Environment Variables** section, add the following names and values, supplying the values given when you created your Immersive Reader resource.

      ```text
        SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY>
        REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
      ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Be sure not to commit any references that contain secrets into source control, as secrets should not be made public**.

14. Set the archive scheme in Xcode by selecting a simulator or device target.
15. In Xcode press Ctrl + R to run the project and the app should launch on the specified simulator or device. Press the Immersive Reader button inside the app and the Immersive Reader will launch.
