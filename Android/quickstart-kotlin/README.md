# Immersive Reader - Android Kotlin Sample

### Installation on Windows

1. Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), Launch Terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/immersive-reader-sdk` to a preferred folder then:
2. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

#### Usage

1. Follow the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/immersive-reader/azure-active-directory-authentication to create an Immersive Reader resource with a custom subdomain and configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication in your Azure tenant. You will need some of the values created here when configuring the sample project properties. Save the output of your session into a text file for future reference.

2. Launch Android Studio and open the project from the \immersive-reader-sdk\Android\quickstart-kotlin\ directory.

3. Add a file named `env` to the `\assets` folder - instead of '.env', use 'env'. Supply your custom property values from step one. Keep this file as a local file that only exists on your machine and be sure not to commit this file into source control, as it contains secrets that should not be made public.

```env
TENANT_ID=<YOUR_TENANT_ID>
CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
SUBDOMAIN=<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>
```

4. Choose a device emulator from the AVD Manager and run the project.
